Fell in love with the machine
Fell in love with you
I made something
That'll love me
Even when I'm wrong
I made something that'll love me
Even with my faults (my faults)
Fell in love with the machine
Fell in love with you
Baby, when we touch
Feels like you were meant to take all my love
Something about you I can't get enough
(I can't get enough)
Fell in love with the machine
Fell in love with you
Baby, when we touch (when we touch)
Feels like you were meant to take all my love
(All of my love)
Something about you I can't get enough
(I can't get enough)
Fell in love with the machine
Fell in love with you
I designed you
With a mind to
Understand my thoughts
I designed you
I refined you
To be what I want
And I want you
