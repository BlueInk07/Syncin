You stay quiet, boy
I know how you feel
You ain’t gotta hide it, ‘cause
You know you’d be lying, and
We could be something for real
You ain’t gotta fight it, no
You ain’t gotta fight it
Na Na-Na
Looking at you
Na Na-Na
You know what I’m tryna do
Oh, I know you feel it, so don’t
No don’t keep me waiting here


(Keep me waiting here)
(I’ma wait right here)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)


These things I’m thinking
When you’re looking in my eyes
And I can’t control
The way you make me feel inside
And now you know
You got a hold on my mind
I don’t wanna fight it
Don’t wanna fight
What you’ve done to me now
I want your love on me, love on me now
Give it all to me now


You know that you like it
So why you tryna fight it
I might put it in reverse
Slow it down, then rewind it
Feels like reckless driving
Fuck it, I’m still riding
And if we gon’ crash
At least i’m living while I’m dying


(Keep me waiting here)
(I’ma wait right here)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)


These things I’m thinking
When you’re looking in my eyes
And I can’t control
The way you make me feel inside
And now you know
You got a hold on my mind
I don’t wanna fight it
Don’t wanna fight
What you’ve done to me now
I want your love on me, love on me now
Give it all to me now
