Hear it in your tone
You're slowly letting go
Are you turning off your phone? (ooh)
Feelings turned cold
So cold, for you
So cold, for you
Oh, I try to break apart, oh oh
You don't wanna try no more?
No more
Why, why? Oh oh
Do you live in my mind, mind, oh
Said you looked past my love (oh)
While I came with open arms
For you
For you
