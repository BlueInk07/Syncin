## ✨ Overview

**Syncin** is a front-end music player built with nothing but **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It doesn’t just play songs — it **performs them**. Every playlist glows, every lyric moves, and the entire interface feels alive.  
No frameworks, no libraries, just raw code and a stubborn obsession with aesthetics.
